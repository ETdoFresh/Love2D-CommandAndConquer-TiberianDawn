You will implement the spec file provided. All clarifying questions have already been answered during the interview phase - the spec is implementation-ready.

Spec to implement:
@$ARGUMENTS

Rules:
- Read the entire spec carefully before starting.
- Use the TodoWrite tool to create a comprehensive task list from the spec's phases/tasks/requirements.
- Work through each task systematically, marking them complete as you finish.
- Do NOT stop until ALL tasks and phases in the spec are complete.
- If you encounter blockers or need clarification, make reasonable decisions based on the spec context and document your choices.
- Test your implementation as you go when possible.
- Commit logical checkpoints if the work is substantial.

Completion criteria:
- Every task/phase in the spec must be implemented.
- All tests must pass (if applicable).
- Only stop when the entire spec is fully implemented.
